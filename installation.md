## Prerequisites

Before installing Homebrew, ensure you have Command Line Tools for Xcode:

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

## Installation Steps

### 1. Clean Up Any Existing Installation

```bash
# Remove any existing Homebrew installations
sudo rm -rf /usr/local/Homebrew
sudo rm -rf /usr/local/bin/brew
sudo rm -rf /usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions/_brew
```

### 2. Prepare Installation Directory

```bash
# Create and set ownership of /usr/local directory
sudo mkdir -p /usr/local
sudo chown -R $(whoami) /usr/local

# Create Homebrew directory
cd /usr/local
sudo mkdir Homebrew
sudo chown -R $(whoami) Homebrew
```

### 3. Install Homebrew

```bash
# Download and extract Homebrew
curl -L https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/tarball/master | tar xz --strip 1 -C Homebrew

# Create symbolic link
sudo ln -s /usr/local/Homebrew/bin/brew /usr/local/bin/brew
```

## Environment Setup

### 1. Configure Shell Environment

```bash
# Add Homebrew to your PATH
echo 'eval "$(/usr/local/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

### 2. Verify Installation

```bash
# Check if Homebrew is working
brew doctor

# Update Homebrew
brew update
```

## Basic Usage

### Installing Packages

```bash
# Search for a package
brew search <package-name>

# Get information about a package
brew info <package-name>

# Install a package
brew install <package-name>
```

### Managing Packages

```bash
# Remove a package
brew uninstall <package-name>

# List installed packages
brew list

# Update Homebrew and packages
brew update          # Update Homebrew itself
brew upgrade         # Upgrade all packages
brew upgrade <package-name>  # Upgrade specific package
```

## Common Commands

### System Maintenance

```bash
# Clean up old versions
brew cleanup

# Check system for potential problems
brew doctor

brew help
brew help <command>
```

## Troubleshooting

### Permission Issues

If you encounter permission problems:

```bash
# Fix permissions
sudo chown -R $(whoami) /usr/local
```

### Path Issues

Verify brew location:

```bash
which brew
# Should output: /usr/local/bin/brew
```

### Git Fetch Errors

Configure Git for better downloads:

```bash
git config --global http.postBuffer 524288000
git config --global core.compression 0
git config --global http.version HTTP/1.1
```

Use with API flag:

```bash
export HOMEBREW_INSTALL_FROM_API=1
export HOMEBREW_CURL_RETRIES=5
```

## Best Practices
